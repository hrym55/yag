Installing additional themes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To shape the look-and-feel of your gallery, you can use different
themes available in TER. Installation is straight forward. Go to the
Extension Manager and search for 'yag'. There should be at least one
theme:

|img-70|

Use the install button to import the extension on your server:

|img-70|

After import, a message will be shown and you can install the theme
click on 'Install extension':

|img-74|

There should be a message, telling you that the extension has been
installed:

|img-75|

Now you have to include the theme's static template on the page you
would like to use the theme. This is done via Template-Module on the
page you want to have the new theme:

|img-76|

Right after that, you should be able to select the theme from within
your FlexForm of the content element that includes your gallery
widget:

|img-77|
