How can you help?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several ways to contribute: First of all, you can install
the extension and give us your feedback. If you like it and use it on
your website, it would be great, if you would let us know the link for
our reference page on `www.yag-gallery.de <http://www.yag-
gallery.de/>`_ . If you would like to help us with development, we can
set up a git account for you and you can easily join the team. If YAG
gallery helps you on a commercial website or you want to donate – feel
free to contact us on `info@yag-gallery.de <mailto:info@yag-
gallery.de>`_

If you need any features to be implemented – yes we also work for
money :-)
