Who made this?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension was developed by `Daniel Lienert
<http://daniel.lienert.cc/>`_ and `Michael Knoll
<http://mimi.kaktusteam.de/>`_ with a lot of help from many different
people. We spent a lot of our free time, implementing all the stuff.
As we could use quite some open source software like TYPO3, Extbase
Extension Framework, FLUID, jQuery and pt\_extlist, we would like to
give something back to the community which we do by uploading this
extension to TER.

Special thanks goes to the Extbase team – Jochen and Sebastian and now
Bastian – you did and do a great job on this one! Both developers of
yag work at `punkt.de <http://www.punkt.de/>`_ in Karlsruhe and could
use quite some software that was developed there and now supports YAG.
So another big thank you goes to Jürgen Egeling for letting us use
punkt.de's extensions to make things a lot easier.

We hope that you enjoy our extension and would appreciate your
feedback. We need you to find all the bugs in there! Please let us
know, if you have any questions or problems: `info@yag-gallery.de
